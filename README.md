# Demo-contacts-crud

This is another AngularJS CRUD-app example.
It is explained in chapter 9 of this book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/AngularJS-Programming-Example-Agus-Kurniawan-ebook/dp/B00JI0Y3PG">AngularJS Programming By Example</a> written by Agus Kurniawan.

This example explains a way how to work with AngularJS, Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

## Install & Run

		npm install
		npm start


Other functions whatever come to my mind will be updated later.

Enjoy!
